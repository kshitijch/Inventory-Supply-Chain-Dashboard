# Inventory & Supply Chain Management Dashboard
Power BI | Data Cleaning | Data Modeling | KPI Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing key inventory and supply chain performance metrics using Power BI. The goal was to build an interactive dashboard that helps businesses monitor warehouse efficiency, optimize inventory, track lead times, analyze transportation costs, and reduce backorders by leveraging data-driven insights.

# Problem Statement

Businesses often struggle with poor visibility into their supply chain operations. Without consolidated analysis, issues like:

Inefficient warehouse utilization

High lead times

Rising transportation costs

Poor demand forecasting

Stockouts / overstock situations

Unmonitored backorders

lead to operational inefficiencies and lost revenue.

To overcome this, an end-to-end Power BI dashboard was developed to convert raw supply-chain data into meaningful and actionable insights.

# Solution Approach (Power BI Only)
1. Data Import

Imported the provided dataset (CSV format) into Power BI.

2. Data Cleaning (Power Query)

Performed transformations to prepare the data for analysis:

Removed duplicate and inconsistent entries

Standardized category and region names

Fixed data types (dates, numbers, categorical fields)

Handled missing or null values

Created additional cleaned columns when required

3. Data Modeling

Built a structured model inside Power BI

Established relationships between all tables

Ensured a clean and optimized data model for faster loading and accurate analysis

4. DAX Measures & KPIs

Created custom measures to calculate:

Warehouse Utilization

Days Sales of Inventory (DSI)

Inventory Turnover Ratio

Transportation Cost Summaries

Backorder Counts

Lead Time Averages

Year-wise Units Sold

These measures power the visuals and make the dashboard dynamic.

5. Dashboard Development

Designed a fully interactive Power BI dashboard showcasing:

# Warehouse & Inventory Metrics

Warehouse Utilization

Days Sales of Inventory

Inventory Turnover Ratio

# Operational Performance

Average Lead Time (category-wise)

Backorders by Order Status

Inventory Level by Region

Units Sold by Year

# Cost & Logistics Insights

Transportation Cost by Region and Category

Each chart includes slicers, tooltips, and drill-downs for deeper exploration.

# Expected Outcomes
# Enhanced Visibility

A single dashboard provides end-to-end clarity on inventory and operational performance.

# Better Decision-Making

Helps identify:

High-cost regions

Slow-moving categories

High backorder zones

Underutilized warehouses

Lead-time inefficiencies

# Cost Optimization

Businesses can reduce excess inventory, control transportation costs, and streamline supply chain operations.

# Performance Improvement

Improved forecasting, better warehouse planning, and reduced delays in order fulfillment.
